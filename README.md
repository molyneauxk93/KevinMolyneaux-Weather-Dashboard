# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Created a Weather Dashboard where users are able to get the current weather, as well as the 5-day forecast for cities they look up using the search functionality. It also has the ability to save previous searches and display the weather for any selected search history item. You can also clear the search history list if desired.
